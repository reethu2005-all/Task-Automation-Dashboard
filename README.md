Task Automation Dashboard
🔍 Project Overview

The Task Automation Dashboard is a Python-based web application designed to automate and monitor common system tasks from a single interactive interface. It helps users reduce manual effort by providing real-time system information, directory management, and automated report generation.

This project demonstrates how automation and system monitoring can be combined into a practical productivity tool.

🎯 Key Features

Interactive dashboard built using Streamlit

Real-time system performance monitoring:
